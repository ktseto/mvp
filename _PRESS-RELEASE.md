# KTS Announces FeatherTransit #

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## An Ultra-Lightweight Next Transit Predictions App for MUNI ##

### Simple interface and user-centric design improve transit experience for All MUNI riders

#### A User-Centric Take on Transit Estimates

#### Summary
  > When you open a transit times prediction app, you want to find out the predicted arrival times for all (and only) your routes, stop, and connection points.  Even though you take only a handful of routes and even fewer stops, all too often you have to 

#### Problem ####
  > San Francisco residents know the Stockholm syndrome all too well, as MUNI's legendary unreliability inflict grave distress on its riders on a daily basis.  To manage the inevitable delays and service disruptions, you need an app that shows you the predicted arrivals of your most frequent routes and stops, including plan B scenarios.
  > (Unverified claim) Most apps out there act more like a data dump:  you have to click through layers of options on transit providers, routes, directions, and stops, just to pull up arrival times for the same handful of routes you travel almost daily.  Rinse and repeat if you want to time your connections.

#### Solution ##
  > The Home Page has a single dashboard that shows the predicted arrival times for only the routes and stops you specified ahead of time.  Any connections and alternate routes you specify will be on the same page, making it easy to evaluate other options when MUNI inevitably disappoints you.
